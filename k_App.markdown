## Below are images of the version of our app which was demo'd to Saska DÃ¶nges and Group 3 on 2020 October 14th
## They are included to serve as instructions for the app
We did successfully create and deploy the app using streamlit and herokaupp.com
<br>However these free services are highly unstable
<br>Subject to availability from these free services, you may be able to access the app by following the link after the images
<br>Should the services not make the app available, 
## We hope that you will review the images extensively
